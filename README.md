# -AI-IoT-Unlocking-Car-Doors-via-custom-built-Facial-Recognition-on-CoreML-powered-by-iPhone-X
Creating a system that combines AI and IoT to unlock car doors via facial recognition, using CoreML and an iPhone X, involves several components. Here's a general breakdown of how to approach this task:

    Facial Recognition: Using CoreML on an iPhone X to process facial recognition.
    IoT Integration**: The car must have an IoT system that can communicate with the iPhone, such as via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or cellular networks.
    Unlocking the Car: Once facial recognition is successful, send a command from the iPhone to the car’s IoT system to unlock the doors.

Breakdown of the Required Components:

    CoreML Facial Recognition Model: Use a pre-trained model for facial recognition or create a custom one.
    Car IoT System: Use a microcontroller (e.g., Raspberry Pi or Arduino) with a mechanism to unlock the car's door (via a solenoid, servo, or electronic latch).
    Bluetooth/Wi-Fi Communication: The iPhone will communicate with the IoT system to send an unlock signal.
    Security: Ensure the entire system is secure, such as with encryption, to prevent unauthorized access.

1. Facial Recognition with CoreML on iPhone X

First, we’ll need to integrate CoreML and Vision to use facial recognition.
Steps:

    Install CoreML: Import a pre-trained model or train one with CreateML or a library like TensorFlow/Keras.
    Use iPhone Camera: Capture frames from the camera.
    Face Detection: Use CoreML for recognizing the face in the camera feed.

Here’s an example code to perform face recognition using CoreML on iPhone X.
CoreML Facial Recognition Code (Swift)

    Set Up CoreML: You will need to integrate a CoreML model for facial recognition. You can use ResNet or any available model for facial feature detection.

    Face Detection via Vision: The Vision framework will help detect faces and send them to a CoreML model for recognition.

ViewController.swift

import UIKit
import Vision
import CoreML
import AVFoundation

class ViewController: UIViewController, AVCaptureVideoDataOutputSampleBufferDelegate {
    
    // UI Elements
    var previewLayer: AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer!
    
    // Model for facial recognition (replace with your CoreML model)
    var model: VNCoreMLModel!

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        // Set up camera
        setupCamera()
        
        // Load the CoreML model for face recognition
        if let modelURL = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "FaceRecognitionModel", withExtension: "mlmodelc") {
            do {
                let coremlModel = try MLModel(contentsOf: modelURL)
                model = try VNCoreMLModel(for: coremlModel)
            } catch {
                print("Error loading model: \(error)")
            }
        }
    }
    
    func setupCamera() {
        // Set up AVCaptureSession to use the camera feed
        let session = AVCaptureSession()
        guard let videoDevice = AVCaptureDevice.default(for: .video),
              let videoDeviceInput = try? AVCaptureDeviceInput(device: videoDevice) else { return }
        
        if session.canAddInput(videoDeviceInput) {
            session.addInput(videoDeviceInput)
        }
        
        let videoDataOutput = AVCaptureVideoDataOutput()
        if session.canAddOutput(videoDataOutput) {
            session.addOutput(videoDataOutput)
            videoDataOutput.setSampleBufferDelegate(self, queue: DispatchQueue(label: "videoQueue"))
        }
        
        previewLayer = AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer(session: session)
        previewLayer.frame = view.bounds
        view.layer.addSublayer(previewLayer)
        
        session.startRunning()
    }
    
    // Called for each frame
    func captureOutput(_ output: AVCaptureOutput, didOutput sampleBuffer: CMSampleBuffer, from connection: AVCaptureConnection) {
        guard let pixelBuffer = CMSampleBufferGetImageBuffer(sampleBuffer) else { return }
        
        // Create a request handler and perform CoreML model recognition
        let request = VNCoreMLRequest(model: model, completionHandler: handleRecognition)
        let handler = VNImageRequestHandler(cvPixelBuffer: pixelBuffer, options: [:])
        
        try? handler.perform([request])
    }
    
    // Handle the result from CoreML model
    func handleRecognition(request: VNRequest, error: Error?) {
        if let results = request.results as? [VNClassificationObservation], let topResult = results.first {
            if topResult.confidence > 0.8 {
                print("Face recognized: \(topResult.identifier)")
                // Call the IoT unlock function here
                unlockCar()
            } else {
                print("No valid face detected")
            }
        }
    }
    
    // IoT command to unlock car
    func unlockCar() {
        // You can use Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or another communication method to send the unlock signal
        // Example: Send unlock command over Bluetooth to the car's IoT system
        print("Unlocking car!")
        
        // Assuming you have Bluetooth or Wi-Fi communication setup
        // Send a message to the IoT system (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Arduino) to unlock the car
    }
}

2. Car IoT System (Raspberry Pi Example)

On the IoT side, you'll need a microcontroller (e.g., Raspberry Pi or Arduino) with a mechanism to unlock the car door. For this, you could use a servo motor or solenoid.
Raspberry Pi Setup:

    Install Python and Libraries: Install libraries for communication (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi).
    Unlock Mechanism: Use GPIO pins to control a servo or solenoid to unlock the door.

Example Python Script for Raspberry Pi to Unlock the Car
unlock_car.py

import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import time
import socket

# Set up GPIO for servo or solenoid
UNLOCK_PIN = 17  # Change to the GPIO pin connected to the locking mechanism

GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
GPIO.setup(UNLOCK_PIN, GPIO.OUT)

def unlock_car():
    print("Unlocking car door...")
    GPIO.output(UNLOCK_PIN, GPIO.HIGH)  # Activate servo or solenoid
    time.sleep(2)  # Hold for 2 seconds to unlock
    GPIO.output(UNLOCK_PIN, GPIO.LOW)  # Deactivate

def start_server():
    server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    server_socket.bind(('0.0.0.0', 9999))  # Listen on all interfaces, port 9999
    server_socket.listen(1)
    
    print("Server listening for connection...")
    
    while True:
        client_socket, client_address = server_socket.accept()
        print(f"Connection from {client_address}")
        
        data = client_socket.recv(1024).decode('utf-8')
        if data == 'unlock':
            unlock_car()
            client_socket.send('Car unlocked'.encode('utf-8'))
        else:
            client_socket.send('Invalid command'.encode('utf-8'))
        
        client_socket.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    start_server()

This script listens for a connection from the iPhone (over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth), and when it receives the command 'unlock', it activates the car’s door unlocking mechanism.
3. IoT Communication with the Car

You can use either Bluetooth or Wi-Fi for communication between the iPhone X and the IoT device (e.g., Raspberry Pi).
iPhone X (Swift) Sends Command to Unlock the Car

    Bluetooth Communication: If using Bluetooth, you would use CoreBluetooth in Swift.
    Wi-Fi Communication: If using Wi-Fi, you can send an HTTP request to the Raspberry Pi’s IP address.

Wi-Fi Communication Example (Swift)

import Foundation

func sendUnlockCommandToCar() {
    let url = URL(string: "http://192.168.1.100:9999")!  // Raspberry Pi IP
    var request = URLRequest(url: url)
    request.httpMethod = "POST"
    request.httpBody = "unlock".data(using: .utf8)

    let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: request) { (data, response, error) in
        if let error = error {
            print("Error unlocking car: \(error)")
            return
        }
        if let data = data, let responseString = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8) {
            print("Response: \(responseString)")
        }
    }

    task.resume()
}

4. Security Considerations

    Authentication: Ensure only authorized users can unlock the car. This could include face recognition or additional security mechanisms like OAuth or encryption.
    Encryption: All communications between the iPhone and the IoT system should be encrypted (e.g., HTTPS or secure Bluetooth).

Conclusion

This project combines AI (facial recognition using CoreML) with IoT (controlling a car door lock via a Raspberry Pi or similar microcontroller). The iPhone X captures and processes facial data, while the car’s IoT system listens for a command to unlock the door. You can expand this project by adding more advanced security, using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or Wi-Fi, and enhancing the user interface for better control.
